### What is machine learning?

Machine learning is the subfield of CS that gives "computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed".

### Major ML techniques

- Regression/Estimation: Predicting continuous values
- Classfication: Predicting the item class/category of a case
- Clustering: Find the structure of data; summarization
- Associations: Associating frequent co-occurring items/events
- Anomaly detection: Discovering abnormal and unusual cases
- Sequence mining: Predicting next event
- Dimension Reduction: Reducing the size of data
- Recommendation systems: Recommending items

### Python libraries for ML

- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- pandas
- scikit-learn

### Supervised learning

- We "teach the model", then with that knowledge, it can predict unknown or future instances
- Teaching the model with labeled data
- The columns are called features
- Two kinds of value of the data:
  - Numerical
  - Categorical
- Types of supervised learning
  - Classification: process of predicting discrete class labels or categories
  - Regression: process of predicting continuous values

### Unsupervised learning

- The model works on its own to discover information
- Data is unlabeled
- Unsupervised learning techniques:
  - Dimension reduction: play a large role by reducing redundant features to make the classification easier
  - Density estimation: a modeling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you're more likely to buy another group of items
  - Market basket analysis: a very simple concept that is mostly used to explore the data to find some structure within it
  - Clustering: considered to be one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning techniques used for grouping data points, or objects that are somehow similar by:
    - Discovering structure
    - Summarization
    - Anomaly detection

### Supervised vs unsupervised learning

| Supervised Learning | Unsupervised Learning |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Classification: classifies labeled data <br /> Regression: Predicts trends using previous labeled data | Clustering: Finds patterns and groupings from unlabeled data | 
| Has more evaluation methods than unsupervised learning | Has fewer evaluation methods than supervised learning |
| Controlled environment | Less controlled environment |
